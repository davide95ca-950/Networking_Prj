# Routing Table Optimization

## Objective
Reduce the number of entries in the routing tables of a multi-router network while maintaining full connectivity.  

## Topology
Network with multiple interconnected routers and an external server reachable from all subnets.  

## Tasks performed
- Initial configuration of static routes.  
- Prefix aggregation where possible.  
- Setup of default routes towards the edge router.  
- Verification with ping and traceroute.  

## Results
- End-to-end connectivity maintained.  
- More compact and readable routing tables.  

## Project versions
- **pt3.zip**: archive with the initial topology.  
- **pt3_final.pkt**: completed final version.
